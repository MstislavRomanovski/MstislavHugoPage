# Making a report on laboratory work
Laboratory work is a small research work that
and should be completed in accordance with all approved requirements. When preparing a lab report, you will learn a number of important elements that will come in handy later.
you when writing term papers and dissertations.
# Report structure
According to GOST 7.32-2001, any research work must be
contain the following elements:
- title page;
- essay;
– introduction;
- the main part;
- conclusion.
GOST also recommends that the following elements be included in the work:
- list of performers;
- content;
- Normative references;
– definitions;
– designations and abbreviations;
– list of sources used;
– applications.
If you are carrying out complex work that is carried out in several stages, then you may
you need to include part or all of the elements of the second list.
# The content of the main elements of the report
- Title page. The first sheet of work is drawn up strictly according to the model, which is usually
provided in the teaching aids for your subject. It not only requires
specify elements such as the name of the educational institution, type of work
and information about the performer, but also arrange them in strict accordance with the standards.
- Abstract. The abstract is actually a summary of your entire report.
and contains some statistical information. It must specify the number of parts,
pages of the work, illustrations, applications, tables, used literary
sources and applications. Here is a list of key words
and the actual text of the abstract. The latter includes the main elements of work
from the set goals to the results and recommendations for their implementation. In practice
institutions of higher education do not usually include abstracts in reports on laboratory work.
– Introduction. In the introduction of a typical laboratory work, goals are usually prescribed
ongoing research and tasks, the implementation of which will help achieve the goals. At the same time, there are works in which students become
real pioneers. Have you ever experienced at least once
feelings of extreme curiosity and impatience while doing lab work?
Feel that in just a couple of minutes you will find the answer to the question to which
no one has ever found an answer yet? It is for such studies that a detailed introduction is written with proof of the relevance and novelty of the topic under study. To
really conduct research in an area in which, as they say, not yet
the foot of a man has stepped, in the introduction you will need to give an assessment of the modern
state of the problem under consideration and justify the need for its solution.
- Main part. Since different universities and disciplines have their own
subtleties of laboratory work, the content of the main part in detail
described in the relevant manuals. It is important that in this section of the work
its essence is reflected, the methodology and results of the work done are described.
The main part contains the following elements:
- the purpose of the study;
– tasks, the implementation of which will help achieve the goals;
- a workflow that describes the actions performed;
- other sections provided for by the methodological materials on the studied
discipline.
- Conclusion. In this part of the work, you will need to draw conclusions based on the results obtained during the laboratory work. To do this, evaluate how fully implemented
assigned tasks. In complex works, other elements may be present,
for example, recommendations for further application of the results of the
work.
