In computer programming, a scientific programming language can refer to two degrees of the same concept.

Broadly speaking, a scientific programming language is a programming language that is widely used in computational science and computational mathematics. In this sense, C/C++ and Python [1] can be considered scientific programming languages.

In a stricter sense, a scientific programming language is a language designed and optimized for the use of mathematical formulas and matrices. [2] Such languages ​​are characterized not only by the presence of libraries that perform mathematical or scientific functions, but also by the syntax of the language itself. [3] For example, neither C++ nor Python has built-in matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication, etc.); instead, this functionality is available through the standard libraries. Scientific programming languages ​​in a stricter sense include ALGOL, APL, Fortran, J, Julia, Maple, MATLAB, and R. [4] [5]

Scientific programming languages ​​should not be confused with scientific language in general, which loosely refers to the higher standards of precision, correctness, and brevity expected of practitioners of the scientific method.
